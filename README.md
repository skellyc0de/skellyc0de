# About Me - skellyc0de

Hey there! I'm **skellyc0de**, a young developer with a passion for creating cool things, mainly in game development and web technologies. I've been into **Roblox** for about 5 years, and I've been developing for it for around 3 years now. I specialize in programming with **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **HTML**, and **Python**, but I enjoy dabbling in a bunch of different tech.

## What I'm Working On
Right now, I'm building a **Luau to HLSL compiler** that will hopefully make it easier for people to create custom shaders in Roblox (since Roblox doesn't officially support them). Itâ€™s a fun challenge, and I canâ€™t wait to see where it goes!

## Skills & Tools I Use
- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, Luau, HTML, CSS
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Roblox Studio, Visual Studio Code
- **Platforms**: Roblox, Web Development, Game Development

## A Little About My Journey
I've been on Roblox for quite a while, and I started out just playing games. But over time, I got more into **game development**â€”first by making simple scripts, and then diving into bigger projects. Nowadays, Iâ€™m all about experimenting with **graphics programming** and learning how to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in Roblox.

## Get in Touch
If you want to chat or collaborate on something fun, feel free to hit me up on **Discord**: `skellycode`. Iâ€™m always up for meeting new devs and sharing ideas.

## P.S.
I'm still learning and growing in the development world, so expect more cool stuff to come. Stay tuned for updates, and thanks for checking out my profile! ðŸ˜Š
